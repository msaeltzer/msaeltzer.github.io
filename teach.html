                              As a teaching assistant at University of Mannheim I focus mainly on making big data available to undergrads.

                              From data collection, management to analysis, I want to provide young researchers the tools they will need to answer their
                              research questions as well as their potential careers in an economy craving for data and those who can understand it.

                              All my courses teach the open source programming language R. Most of my course materials are publically available on Github. Feel free
                              to get an impression, both as student and instructor.
